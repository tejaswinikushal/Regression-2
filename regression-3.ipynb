    "#### Ridge Regression:\n",
    "                L2 regularization, is a linear regression technique that introduces a regularization term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) objective function. The goal of Ridge Regression is to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization by adding a penalty term to the sum of squared residuals.\n",
    "                \n",
    "                The key difference between Ridge Regression and ordinary least squares regression is the addition of the regularization term. Ordinary least squares seeks to find the coefficients that minimize the sum of squared residuals, while Ridge Regression adds a regularization term that penalizes large coefficients. "

    "         Ridge Regression assumes that the relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable is linear.\n",

    "#### Independence: \n",
    "         The observations should be independent of each other. This assumption is similar to the independence assumption in OLS regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Homoscedasticity: \n",

    "#### Multicollinearity: \n",
    "           Ridge Regression is often used when there is multicollinearity among the predictor variables. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in the model are highly correlated, which can lead to instability in the estimation of coefficients in OLS regression. Ridge Regression addresses this issue by introducing a penalty term that helps stabilize the estimates.\n",

    "#### Normality of Residuals:\n",

    "Magnitude of Coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients in Ridge Regression are penalized for being too large. As a result, the magnitude of the coefficients is typically smaller compared to the coefficients in ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. A smaller coefficient indicates a smaller impact of the corresponding predictor on the response variable.\n",
    "Shrinkage Toward Zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary effect of Ridge Regression is to shrink the coefficients toward zero. This is especially beneficial when dealing with multicollinearity, as it helps stabilize the estimates of the regression coefficients.\n",

    "Ridge Regression can be used for time-series data analysis, but its application to time-series data requires consideration of certain factors specific to temporal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "there are ways to adapt Ridge Regression for time-series analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Autoregressive Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "In time-series analysis, it's common to include lagged values of the response variable (autoregressive components) as predictors. Ridge Regression can accommodate these autoregressive components by treating them as additional features. Including lagged values allows the model to capture temporal dependencies.\n",
    "#### Stationarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression, like other linear regression techniques, assumes stationarity. If the time series exhibits non-stationarity (e.g., trends or seasonality), preprocessing steps such as differencing may be necessary to make the data stationary before applying Ridge Regression.\n",
    "#### Tuning Parameter Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of the tuning parameter (λ) in Ridge Regression becomes crucial. Cross-validation methods, such as time series cross-validation or rolling-window cross-validation, can be employed to determine an optimal \n",
    "λ value that generalizes well to unseen future data points."
